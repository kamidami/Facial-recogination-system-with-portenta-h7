## Overview

This project implements a facial recognition system using the Portenta H7, Portenta Vision Shield, and Portenta Breakout. The system captures images, processes them using MicroPython, and performs facial expression recognition using a custom-trained deep learning model from Edge Impulse. If the accuracy of the facial expression recognition is above 98%, the system confirms the match; otherwise, no message is displayed.

## Features

- **Facial Recognition:** Utilizes the Portenta Vision Shield to capture images and perform facial expression recognition.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Custom-trained deep learning model from Edge Impulse for accurate facial expression recognition.
- **MicroPython:** Code is written in MicroPython, making it efficient and suitable for embedded systems.

## Requirements

### Hardware

- Arduino Portenta H7
- Portenta Vision Shield
- Portenta Breakout
- (Add any other hardware requirements)

### Software

- MicroPython
- Edge Impulse (for training the deep learning model)
- (Add any other software dependencies)

## Installation


1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Install the required software dependencies:

   - **Edge Impulse:** Follow the [Edge Impulse documentation](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/cli-installation) to install the Edge Impulse CLI for model training.

   - **OpenMV:** Install the OpenMV IDE on your development machine. You can find installation instructions on the [OpenMV website](https://openmv.io/pages/download).

   - **Custom Dataset:** Ensure you have a custom dataset of facial expression images for training your model. Organize the dataset and follow the guidelines provided by Edge Impulse for model training.

   - **Hardware Setup:** Connect the Arduino Portenta H7, Portenta Vision Shield, and Portenta Breakout according to the hardware setup guide provided in the [docs/hardware-setup.md](docs/hardware-setup.md).

3. Flash the MicroPython code onto your Portenta H7 using the OpenMV IDE.

 ## Usage

1. Train the Deep Learning Model:

   - Use the Edge Impulse platform to train your custom facial expression recognition model. Follow the steps provided in the [Edge Impulse documentation](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/).

2. Upload the Trained Model:

   - Once the model is trained, download the model files from Edge Impulse and upload them to the Portenta H7 using the OpenMV IDE.

3. Run the Facial Recognition System:

   - Power on the system and run the facial recognition script on the Portenta H7.

   ```python
   # Example command
   python main.py
The system will capture images using the Portenta Vision Shield, process them, and display a message confirming a match if the facial expression accuracy is above 98%. If the accuracy is below the threshold, no message will be displayed.
